        <p class="home-desc">The Union Buildings in Pretoria are a symbol of South Africa's political history and unity. Designed by Sir Herbert Baker, they were constructed between 1910 and 1913 to serve as the official seat of the South African government. Located atop Meintjieskop, the highest point in Pretoria, the buildings are an architectural masterpiece combining neoclassical, Cape Dutch, and Edwardian styles.</p>
